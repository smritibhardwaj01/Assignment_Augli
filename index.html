        Hey, this Smriti Bhardwaj, a keen writer and a web developer. I started writing as a means of 
        pocket money but soon enough fell in love with it. I am currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer 
        Science and engineering. I completed my school level education from the C.S.K.M Public School 
        (both 10th and 12th standard from CBSE board). Fortunately, with all the hard work I was able 
        to score 10 CGPA in the 10th grade and 87.4% in 12th grade.</br></br>
        
        My area of expertise is writing general articles that might include issues related to lifestyle. 
        Besides writing, I have a keen interest in developing websites and playing with the technology 
        makes me happy.</br></br>

        This is a content highlighter. I have created it in such a manner that if you select any text you 
        will be shown an option to highlight that text. This content highlighter is inspired by medium.
